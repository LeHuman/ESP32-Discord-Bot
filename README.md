# ESP32 Discord Bot - WIP

A very basic setup for an ESP32 that allows it to be used as a discord bot

## How to Use

Use the VSCode Espressif IDF extension for easier config and programming

### Hardware Required

This setup was built around a ESP DEVKITV1 which uses the ESP-WROOM-32

### Configure the project

* Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`)
* Configure various Discord bot details under "ESP config"

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
